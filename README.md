# Basic-React-Project
A basic template project setup to include/use React, Bootstrap, eslint and Sass. Webpack is used to bundle the js modules.

# Getting Started
Install dependencies with `npm install`

There are two options for building/running the project:

1. `npm run dev` to run using webpack-dev-server. Browse to `http:\\localhost:8080`
2. `webpack` followed by `npm run start` to run using my own Node.js Express server implementation. Browse to `http:\\localhost:8000`
